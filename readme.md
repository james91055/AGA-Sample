# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor Challenge

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards 
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements 
(not using <div> or <span>)
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
(The styling and positioning are all following the mock-up)
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
(Adding description of the pictures)
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
(The header fall from h1->h2->h3)
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
(Changing the title to Horizeon)
```
